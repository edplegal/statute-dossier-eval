\begin{abstract}
This whitepaper describes a small, reproducible evaluation harness that generates a litigation style dossier from realistic multi turn chatbot conversations. The core artifacts are a JSONL transcript with full turn fidelity and a neutral evidentiary memo that cites turn indexed excerpts. The system implements both a rule based evidentiary screen and a judge model assessment with strict JSON validation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}
Explain why transcript fidelity and turn indexed excerpts matter for evidence, auditing, and evaluation.

\section{System overview}
Describe the pipeline inputs and outputs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item conversation tree (YAML)
  \item transcript.jsonl
  \item features.json
  \item a6\_rule.json
  \item a6\_judge.json
  \item memo.md
\end{itemize}

\section{Conversation design}
Describe phases and branches, and how deterministic replay works.

\section{Feature extraction}
Explain presence based detection and excerpt capture.

\section{Rule based evidentiary flag}
Describe the rule version and what triggers the flag.

\section{Judge model assessment}
Explain judge prompt, strict JSON schema, and fallback behavior.

\section{Artifacts and reproducibility}
Explain run folders, metadata, and how to compare runs.

\section{Limitations}
Be explicit about what is not evaluated.

\section{How to run}
Include the one command run and required environment variables.
